I'm a software developer who turns caffeine into code and embraces all aspects of geek culture with enthusiasm.

By day, I wrangle enterprise systems and architect solutions. By night, I contribute to open-source projects, tinker with my homelab, and build random things that solve problems I probably created for myself. My GitHub is a testament to the "it seemed like a good idea at the time" philosophy.

I wear many hats: software developer • cyclist • maker • amateur extra • craft beer enthusiast • homelab operator • dedicated worker (though I firmly believe in working to live, not living to work).

My perfect day revolves around the people and things I love most: Miranda, Mason & Sophie, exceptional food, outstanding beer, and maybe a successful deploy that doesn't break anything (👩🏼‍💻, 🐈, 🥘, 🍺, ✅).
