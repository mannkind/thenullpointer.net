I'm a multifaceted nerd who embraces all aspects of geek culture with enthusiasm.

I wear many hats: open-source software developer • cyclist • maker • amateur extra • craft beer enthusiast • dedicated worker (though I firmly believe in working to live, not living to work).

My perfect day revolves around the people and things I love most: Miranda, Mason & Sophie, exceptional food, and outstanding beer (👩🏼‍💻, 🐈, 🥘, 🍺).

My iMessage public verification code is:
