A year that changed everything—meeting my soulmate, embracing new adventures, and achieving the impossible.

### New Relationship

The single best thing to happen to me all year occurred on April 17th—the day I met Miranda at the 72nd Street Cafe near Green Lake.

From the moment we started talking, the chemistry was undeniable. After that first meeting, I couldn't get enough of her company (and still can't). I can honestly say I've never been happier in my entire life. Everything is simply better with Miranda in it.

I'm incredibly thankful and unbelievably lucky to have such an intelligent, caring, funny, witty, beautiful, and all-around wonderful woman in my life.

### Motorcycle

After months of contemplating whether to buy a motorcycle, I finally took the plunge. I got my endorsement, did my research, and bought a 2006 Suzuki SV650.

It's an absolute blast to ride!

### Seattle to Portland

In July, Chris and I conquered the ultimate endurance challenge: riding our bicycles [204 miles from Seattle to Portland](http://cyclemeter.com/c7d2ff5a4d49beb4/Cycle-20110709-0520?v=1).

**In. One. Day.**

It wasn't easy. After the first 150 miles, it definitely wasn't fun anymore. But crossing that finish line remains one of the most amazing accomplishments of my life.
