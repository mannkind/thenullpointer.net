A year of workplace frustrations, major living changes, and exciting family milestones.

### Work

I find myself questioning how much longer I'll stay with Facilities. The job isn't terrible, but my lack of control over the websites I'm responsible for is becoming increasingly frustrating. There's nothing worse than being held accountable for things you can't actually influence.

### Moving

My living situation changed dramatically when Gordy relocated to California, forcing me to find new housing. I ended up moving from Seattle to Auburn to live with my grandparents.

Living in Auburn has been quite an adjustment. The commute is brutal—requiring either a drive to the Auburn Sounder Station or the Federal Way Transit Center—and it's definitely put strain on my relationship. Sometimes practical decisions come with unexpected emotional costs.

### Family

My sister got married! YAY! And I'm going to be an uncle soon! 

I'm equal parts excited and terrified—hopefully I won't screw this up _too_ badly. I have big aspirations of being the _cool_ uncle, though I'm not entirely sure what that entails yet.
