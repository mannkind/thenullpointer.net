The highlights from 2012—bold moves, life-changing commitments, and everything falling perfectly into place.

### New Job

In June, I left my position with Facilities Services to start fresh with University Services (UW-IT). Sometimes you need to take a leap of faith and hope for the best—here's to being happier, at least for a while.

### Engagement

I got engaged to the most beautiful woman in the world! The move from North Seattle to South Seattle with Miranda marks the beginning of our shared adventure.

Still can't quite believe this actually happened.

### For Sale

I listed my house for sale and couldn't believe what happened next—within 24 hours, I had **two** full-price offers on the table.

Sometimes the universe aligns in ways that feel almost too good to be true. Here's hoping the rest of the process goes just as smoothly.
