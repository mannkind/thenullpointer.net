A year of bold moves, life-changing commitments, and everything falling perfectly into place.

### New Job

In June, I left my position with Facilities Services to start fresh with University Services (UW-IT). Sometimes you need to take a leap of faith and hope for the best—here's to being happier, at least for a while.

### Engagement

I got engaged to the most beautiful woman in the world! The move from North Seattle to South Seattle with Miranda marks the beginning of our shared adventure.

### For Sale

I listed my house for sale and couldn't believe what happened next—within 24 hours, I had **two** full-price offers on the table.

Sometimes the universe aligns in ways that feel almost too good to be true. Here's hoping the rest of the process goes just as smoothly.
