A year of stunning wilderness adventures, family growth, and letting go of the unnecessary.

### The High Divide Trail

Miranda and I tackled the High Divide Trail with my brother-in-law Mark—an epic 18-mile loop through Olympic National Park that tested our endurance and rewarded us with breathtaking views.

This wasn't an easy hike by any measure, but the beauty we encountered was absolutely transcendent. There's something magical about pushing your physical limits in such a spectacular setting.

### Niblings

Our family welcomed a new addition—Rosalind Jane Farrar—and the Littles moved back to Washington! I can't adequately express how **thrilled** this makes me. After too long living far apart, I'll finally be able to see my sister, brother-in-law, and niblings on a regular basis.

There's nothing quite like having family close by again.

### Goodbye, Spec-B

I also parted ways with my last **major worldly possession** in 2015—my 2008 Legacy Spec-B. I purchased it in 2010 with around 33,000 miles and sold it five years later with only 45,000 miles. You could say I wasn't exactly putting it through its paces.

I don't see the point in keeping something I'm not actively using, so off it went to someone who would appreciate it more than I was.
