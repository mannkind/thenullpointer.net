The memorable moments from 2015—wilderness adventures, family growth, and learning when to let go.

### The High Divide Trail

Miranda and I tackled the High Divide Trail with my brother-in-law Mark—an epic 18-mile loop through Olympic National Park that definitely tested our limits.

This wasn't exactly a leisurely stroll, but the payoff was absolutely worth it. There's something about pushing yourself to the edge of exhaustion while surrounded by that kind of beauty that just puts everything in perspective.

### Niblings

Our family welcomed a new addition—Rosalind Jane Farrar—and the Littles moved back to Washington! I can't adequately express how thrilled this makes me. After way too long living far apart, I'll finally get to see my sister, brother-in-law, and niblings on a regular basis.

Having family close by again? Priceless.

### Goodbye, Spec-B

I also parted ways with my last **major worldly possession** in 2015—my 2008 Legacy Spec-B. I purchased it in 2010 with around 33,000 miles and sold it five years later with only 45,000 miles. You could say I wasn't exactly putting it through its paces.

I don't see the point in keeping something I'm not actively using, so off it went to someone who would appreciate it more than I was.
