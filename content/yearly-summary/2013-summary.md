A year of profound transitionsâ€”letting go of the past and embracing the future.

### Going, Going, Gone!

I sold two of my three **major worldly possessions** this year: my beloved 2006 Suzuki SV650 and my first-ever house on Ashworth Ave N.

Sometimes life requires you to shed what once defined you to make room for what's coming next.

### Wedding

This summer, I married the woman of my dreams in what can only be described as the most perfect day of my life.

The details matter: my ring is engraved with the geo-coordinates of the place we first met, while hers bears a rhyme to remember the moment that changed everything. ðŸ˜‰
