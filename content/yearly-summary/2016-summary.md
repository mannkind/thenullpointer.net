The unforgettable moments from 2016—triumph, adventure, and life-altering challenges that changed everything.

### Seattle to Portland

Miranda and I accomplished something incredible: riding our bicycles [204 miles from Seattle to Portland](http://cyclemeter.com/c7d2ff5a4d49beb4/Cycle-20160716-0545?v=1) in a single day.

What an achievement as a couple! The months of preparation were intense—our entire spring was consumed by training rides, building endurance, and preparing our bodies for this epic challenge. (Apparently, I hadn't learned my lesson from 2011.)

### Thunder Creek / Junction Camp

We embarked on our first solo backpacking adventure at [Thunder Creek](http://cyclemeter.com/c7d2ff5a4d49beb4/Path-20170110-0944?v=1), which was supposed to be a gentle 5-6 mile valley hike alongside a river. That's what we were told, anyway.

Our original plan was to camp at McAllister, but when we arrived, both that site and the next were completely full. The ranger cheerfully suggested Junction Camp—"just an extra three miles down the trail." No problem, we thought. We'd just conquered Seattle to Portland! How hard could three more miles be?

What the ranger conveniently forgot to mention was that those three miles weren't just _down_ the trail—they were **up** an additional 2,500 feet of elevation gain.

By the time we dragged ourselves into Junction Camp, we were completely spent.

Despite feeling misled, it turned out to be an awesome experience and a genuine accomplishment. Sometimes the best adventures are the ones that push you beyond what you thought possible.

### Health Issues

In October, our world shifted dramatically. Miranda experienced a sudden, severe health crisis—a constellation of conditions that would change her life for the foreseeable future.

That night was absolutely terrifying and served as the most jarring wake-up call imaginable.

I'll never forget that experience, unfortunately. I'm grateful that Miranda doesn't remember most of it—the brain's ability to shield us from certain traumas is a mercy.
