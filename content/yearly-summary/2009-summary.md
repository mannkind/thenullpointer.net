A year of major milestones, relationship shifts, and unexpected connections.

### Moving

I'm definitely sensing a theme in my life at this point.

I bought a house! It's simultaneously the most exciting and terrifying thing I've ever done. Now I feel completely crushed by the mountain of debt that is my mortgage, but at least I won't have to move every single year anymore.

Well, at least for the time being. (Narrator: he would indeed move again.)

### Relationships

Caryolnn moved out. *Le sigh.* Our relationship has been rocky these past few months, so maybe some space will be good for both of us. Sometimes you need distance to gain perspective.

### Going, Going, Gone

I sold my first car—my beloved 1991 Mustang. Since moving to Seattle, I've barely been driving it; the poor thing was just sitting on the street collecting dust and parking tickets.

I don't see the point in keeping something I'm not actually using, so off it went to someone who would appreciate it more.

### New Friends

I also (re)met Chris and Adriana—people I'd originally encountered on a bus in Federal Way, of all places. They seem like genuinely cool people, and it's wonderful that they live close by.

Sometimes the best friendships start in the most unexpected ways.
