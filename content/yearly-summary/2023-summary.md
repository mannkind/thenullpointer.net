The standout moments from 2023—a year defined by staying put, milestone celebrations, and deepening relationships.

### Staying in One Spot

For the first time in years, we didn't move in 2023. 😂

This was primarily because Miranda threatened my life if I even suggested it. Secondarily, because Mason and Sophie would have been thoroughly confused by yet another relocation. And finally, because all the uncertainty that drove our 2022 move was still very much _a thing_ throughout 2023. 🔮

Sometimes the best decision is simply to stay still and let life settle around you.

### Turning 40

I hit the big 4-0 this year—another major milestone on life's winding path. 🎉

The timing couldn't have been more perfect: I was in London, my favorite city in the world, visiting friends when the birthday arrived.

For those keeping track (and who isn't?), this marks the second age-related milestone I've celebrated in London. I turned 21 there during my college study abroad program, and now 40 as a slightly more mature adult. There's something poetic about bookending these decades in the same place that holds so many memories.

### 10 Year Anniversary

Miranda and I celebrated our 10-year anniversary this year. 💒🍰

Miranda remains my favorite person in the entire world. Whether we're exploring new cities, hopping between breweries, navigating another cross-country move, adopting rescue kittens, or just handling the mundane rhythms of daily life—there's nobody I'd rather share it all with.

For whatever reason, she's still hanging around _(narrator: it's definitely the kittens)_, and I'll take it. 💑
