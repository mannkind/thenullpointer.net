A milestone year marking the end of one chapter and the beginning of my professional life.

### Graduated from UW

I graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor of Science in Informatics—a moment that meant more to my family than I initially realized.

I'm the first person in my family to graduate from a four-year institution. While others have earned Associate degrees from community college, I'm the trailblazer with a bachelor's degree. There's something both humbling and empowering about being the first to reach this particular milestone.

### New Job

After countless applications and interviews, I landed my first real career position: Technology Administrator for Facilities Services at the University of Washington.

I know, I know—staying at the same institution where I just graduated might seem unambitious. But hey, I've got student loans to pay back!

### Gaming

I scored both a PS3 and a Wii this year! Getting the Wii turned into quite the adventure, though not one I got to experience personally—I had to work that day.

Instead, my grandmother, sister, and girlfriend camped out in front of Walmart (ugh!) all night to snag a few consoles. I'm genuinely surrounded by the most amazing women who would endure overnight retail camping for my gaming habits.
