A year of new locations, growing relationships, and adorable new family members.

### Moving

Carolynn and I took the plunge and moved to Federal Way together, though I'm still adjusting to feeling somewhat isolated from my Seattle friends.

I continue saving for a house, but despite having stable employment, homeownership feels frustratingly out of reach. Maybe the _American Dream_ isn't meant for everyone—or maybe I just need to be more patient. (Spoiler alert: patience was indeed required.)

### Kittehs

Carolynn and I adopted two absolutely adorable kittens—Domino and Cali. They're complete pains in the ass, destroying everything in sight and keeping us up all night, but I love them fiercely.

It's going to be amazing watching them grow from tiny troublemakers into slightly larger troublemakers.
