The highlights from 2025—a year of personal victories, home improvements, and Canadian adventures.

### 1000 Miles: Mission Accomplished

I hit my 1000-mile walking goal around two weeks before the end of the year, which felt pretty damn good. There's something satisfying about setting an ambitious target and then actually following through on it.

Turns out consistency wins when it comes to walking a ridiculous number of miles. Who knew?

### House Projects (Finally)

We tackled some big house projects that we'd been putting off way too long. New electric blinds, because apparently we're fancy now. Cut down a tree that had been silently judging us from the front yard. And got a new couch, which looks suspiciously like the old couch, just larger.

The blinds are legitimately life-changing—no more getting up to manually adjust them like some kind of caveman; technology for the win.

### Canada Adventure

We made our first trip to Toronto and had an absolute blast.

Toronto was fantastic, but seeing Niagara Falls in person? That definitely lived up to the hype. There's something humbling about standing next to that much raw natural power.

The whole Canadian experience was great—good food, friendly people, and surprisingly easy border crossings (thanks, Nexus passes from 2019!). We're definitely going back.



### Comedy Shows

Had some great comedy experiences this year. Seth Meyers at the Seattle Zoo was hilarious and there's something surreal about stand-up comedy surrounded by zoo animals. Nate Bargatze at Climate Pledge Arena was exactly what you'd expect: perfectly crafted, wonderfully awkward humor delivered flawlessly.

Also made it to The Great Outdoor Comedy Festival in Vancouver, BC where I saw John Mulaney, Mike Birbiglia, Nick Kroll, and Fred Armisen. What a fantastic lineup—each comedian brought their own style and the outdoor venue added something special to the whole experience.

Sometimes you don't realize how much you need to laugh until someone really good makes you do it for two hours straight.

### Health Wins

By the end of 2025, I'd lost nearly 40 pounds through hard work and drugs. If I'm honest, a lot of it was drugs.  

The walking goal tied into this perfectly. Those 1000 miles weren't just about hitting a number; they became a consistent calorie burn and mental health boost. Some days it felt like a chore, but most days it was the best part of my routine. There's something meditative about putting one foot in front of the other for miles at a time.

The "drugs" part was embracing GLP-1 medication after years of thinking I should be able to do it all through willpower alone. Best decision I made all year. It didn't do the work for me, but it finally gave me the breathing room to make better choices without feeling constantly hungry or obsessing about food. The mental relief was as important as the physical effects.

What surprised me most was how much better I felt beyond just the weight loss. Better sleep, more energy, clothes fitting again, and that general sense of momentum that comes from actually following through on something important. It's amazing how one positive change can ripple out into other areas of life.
