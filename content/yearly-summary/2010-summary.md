A year of significant losses, difficult endings, and one beautiful bright spot.

### Work/Family/Relationships

2010 brought a perfect storm of life changes, and not all of them were welcome. Work became increasingly frustrating and unfulfilling. My sister and her family relocated to Virginia, taking away some of my closest family connections. And I ended my long-term relationship when my girlfriend moved back to California.

It was a year of saying goodbye to important parts of my life. ðŸ˜­

### Spec-B

After feeling increasingly trapped in Seattle over the past year, I decided I needed something to restore my sense of freedom and possibility. So I bought a carâ€”not just any car, but a 2008 Subaru Legacy Spec-B.

_Damn, I love that car._

Sometimes the solution to feeling stuck is simply finding a new way to move forward.
