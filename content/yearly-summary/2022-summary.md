The major chapters from 2022—a year of unexpected moves, heartbreaking goodbyes, and joyful new beginnings.

### Moving (Again)

We bought a house in Renton, WA, marking our return to the central Puget Sound region after just one year in Bellingham.

While our Bellingham adventure definitely "paid off" in many ways, it didn't unfold quite as we'd imagined. Why did we decide to move back so quickly?

The future of remote work became incredibly uncertain for Miranda. Combined with broader economic anxieties—looming recession, skyrocketing interest rates, general financial instability—we decided to hedge our bets by moving closer to the urban core. If employers were going to force a "return to the office," we figured we might as well be strategically positioned near said offices.

In an unexpected twist, we also became accidental landlords in 2022. We attempted to sell the Bellingham house _just_ as the real estate market began its dramatic shift. Had we listed a month or two earlier, we'd have been golden. But sometimes timing is everything, and our timing was spectacularly off.

Looking back, though, maybe it worked out exactly as it should have. You couldn't buy property and build an ADU for anywhere close to what we paid for the Bellingham house. Perhaps being reluctant land barons will prove to be a blessing in disguise.

### Goodbye to Our Furry Friend

2022 brought the heartbreaking loss of Scrambles, our beloved cat. She developed a bulging disc in her spine and, at her advanced age, wasn't a candidate for surgery. When the recommended medications began causing complications without providing relief, we faced the impossible decision every pet owner dreads.

> Our sweet little floofy friend, thank you for being part of our lives. We'll miss everything about you—your silly antics, your demanding cuddles, your purrs, your meows, and yes, even your floof covering every surface of our home.
> 
> You'll always live in our hearts and memories.
> 
> We love you, Scrambles. ❤️

### San Diego Vacation + Multi-State Road Trip

September brought an epic adventure spanning multiple states and celebrating Miranda's birthday in style.

We spent several glorious days in San Diego, walking nearly 20 miles around the city, soaking up the California sunshine, and eating our way through the local food scene. But that was just the warm-up act.

Immediately after returning home, we embarked on a multi-day road trip to Rexburg, Idaho. Why Rexburg, you ask?
