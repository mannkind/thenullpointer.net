Here are the highlights from my 2024—a year of adventures, setbacks, and new beginnings.

### Hawaii - Mother-in-law Friends (MILFs)
This spring, Miranda and I took both our mothers to Maui. The acronym was too good to pass up.

Hawaii had been at the top of my mom's bucket list forever, so when Miranda suggested making it a multi-generational trip, I knew we had to make it happen. It turned out to be one of those perfect vacation experiences you remember for years.

We packed our days with adventures: ziplining through rainforest canopies, catching the sunrise at Haleakalā National Park (worth the 4 AM wake-up call), lounging on pristine beaches, and indulging in incredible food and shopping. Watching my mom experience her first Hawaiian sunset was worth the entire trip.

### Seattle to Portland 
In July, I attempted the Seattle to Portland bike ride—204 grueling miles in a single day. Key word: _attempted_.

I felt strong through the first 90 miles, hitting all my nutrition and hydration marks just like in training. Then, around mile 90, my right leg began cramping. By mile 114, I couldn't turn the pedals anymore. My parents, who live nearby, came to rescue me and my wounded pride.

What frustrates me most is the mystery of it all. I'd completed training rides longer than 90 miles without any cramping issues. Same bike, same gear, same nutrition timing—everything identical to my successful training rides. Was it the weather? Pre-ride nerves? Donating blood a few weeks prior? I'll never know.

But my biggest regret isn't the DNF itself—it's what I did afterward. I was so grumpy and defeated that I went straight home instead of staying overnight at my parents' house and finishing the ride the next morning. Sure, it wouldn't have been the official one-day STP, but at least I would have completed the full route. Sometimes pride gets in the way of perseverance.

### New Job
After three years at Stash, I decided it was time to move on. The company had changed dramatically during my tenure, and by the time I left, the writing was on the wall about its future prospects.

In July, I started a new role at Earnest, a fintech company specializing in student loan refinancing. They have offices in Oakland and Salt Lake City, but I continue working fully remote—extending my work-from-home journey that began during the pandemic.
