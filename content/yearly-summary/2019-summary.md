The adventures and misadventures that defined 2019â€”from bureaucratic nightmares to outdoor euphoria.

### Nexus Passes

Getting our Nexus passes turned into an epic saga involving approval delays, government shutdowns, and **snowmageddon**.

After multiple reschedulings, we finally had our interview appointment in Blaine. The night before, we obsessively checked weather forecasts for both Seattle and Blaineâ€”everything looked clear. The drive north started perfectly, with cities just south of the border seeing no snow at all.

Then we arrived in Blaine, and so did the snowstorm.

We completed our interview as quickly as possible and fled town just as the storm intensified. The drive home was a white-knuckled odyssey of slow speeds and careful navigation, but we made it safely.

I have complicated feelings about the Nexus Trusted Traveler Program. It shouldn't be necessary, and I resent paying for the privilege of efficient travel. But my time is valuable to me, and it's hard to argue with walking into an airport and clearing security in under five minutes.

### Texas - San Antonio and Dallas

Spring brought a dual-purpose trip to Texas, piggy-backing on a conference in San Antonio with tourist time in Dallas to visit my grandmother.

We had an amazing time exploring Dallas, though I lost all my photos when my phone died the day after we returned. Technology: sometimes it giveth, sometimes it thoroughly taketh away. ðŸ˜¢

### Hiking, Backpacking, and Fishing

Summer exploded with outdoor adventuresâ€”probably more hiking and backpacking than all our previous years combined. We even became regular users of the [Trailhead Direct](https://trailheaddirect.org) service, which proved to be a game-changer.

Our adventures included Margaret's Way, Mt. Si, Mailbox Peak, Malakwa Lake, Clear Lake, Ollalie Lake, Lake 22, and countless others. ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„

We also upgraded my ancient REI Quarter Dome tent to a Nemo Dagger 3. Lighter weight makes me happy, more space makes Miranda happyâ€”everyone wins.

I discovered a new passion for fishing during our hikes. While I haven't caught anything worth bragging about, just being out there casting has become meditative and fun. It's also given us great excuses to explore new corners of the region.

### Colorado - Denver and The Great American Beer Festival

Fall took us to Denver, Coloradoâ€”a first for both of us. Denver struck me as a compelling landlocked alternative to the Pacific Northwest, offering similar outdoor activities with significantly less rain. I'd love to return specifically to explore the Rocky Mountains.

But this trip wasn't about mountainsâ€”it was about **beer**. We were there for the Great American Beer Festival! After years of talking about attending GABF without ever following through, we finally committed. Last year in Hawaii with Chris and Adriana, we made the pact that 2019 would be the yearâ€”and we delivered.

GABF exceeded every expectation and I'd absolutely go again. Though next time, I'd spend the pre- and post-festival days exploring Colorado's outdoor offerings instead of brewery hopping. By the festival's end, I was thoroughly done with beer for quite a while.
